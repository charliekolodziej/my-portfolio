<!-- Reflection & AI Disclosure 

To start the website I used chatgpt.com and gave it the following prompt: "Can you provide me with HTML code for a journalism portolio. It should include the following sections: Header, About, Work, Projects, Resume, Contact, Footer."

From there I edited the template that chatgpt provided using various CSS and HTML design elements we learned in class. I changed the "Header" color to a light blue using the W3 Schools hexcode picker. I also added a headshot and several photos under the "projects" section. I decided to keep the navigation on the site fairly simple with clear blocks that contain each section. These make it easy to navigate the website. I used a light gray background with black text to make sure the information is easy to read. 

I also used large h2 section headers outline the site. I used <p><br></p> to create breaks between information. This made the site easier to read and allowed for some nice breathing room in the design. 

For the "Selected Work" section, I used <article class="card"> to create clear cards that could contain info on each of the articles. I think this distinguished them nicely off from other design elements on the page.
